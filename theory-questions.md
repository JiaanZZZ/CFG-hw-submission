### What is React? (E.g. Consider: what is it? What is the benefit of using it? What is its virtual DOM? Why would someone choose it over the standard HTML / CSS stack?) (15 marks)
React is a javascript library created by Facebook. Components are the building blocks of any React application and an app usually consists of multiple reusable components. React uses virtual DOM to compare the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the real DOM that were changed so that the performance is improved. Virtual DOM is associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface which are kept in memory and synced with the real DOM. Data flow is unidirectional. For example, parent component data can be accessed from the child component if the child component is nested by the parent component. In addition, React combines HTML and Javascript together so that functionality can be added to basic HTML directly.

### What are Props? What is State? What is the difference between them? (10 marks)
Props are variables passed to the component by its parent component while State is still variables and directly initialized and managed by the component. Name is a state in sampleParent component and passed as a prop to sampleChild class.

### What are React Hooks? How do they differ from existing lifecycle methods? (10 marks)
React hooks are built-in functions that allow React developers to use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components. With hooks, you can reuse logic between your components without changing their architecture or structure. Hooks allow separating a particular single component into various smaller functions based upon. Before Hooks were published, if the code was written using functional React components, you need to rewrite components as classes that extend React Component with a dedicated render function to handle lifecycle events. Lifecycle methods include componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount.

### Design the perfect door - what should it look like, what are the components for it? What design heuristics should it follow, and how does your design match? What made you choose this design? (20 marks). 
Consider in particular (likely need to do independent learning): who are your stakeholders? What are their personas? What are the doors requirements and how will your stakeholders benefit from your solution?
Nowadays, we can always see a customer who tries to get into a restaurant but at first, gets a bit confused when they open the door. Users always struggle with pulling, pushing, or sliding the door which does affect their experience in the restaurant in the first place. The visibility of door status is important in order to show how users should do action. Other than using words like PULL/ PUSH, a visible icon such as an arrow can be introduced to the door. If it is PULL, then the arrow should be pointing towards the user (outside). And if it is PUSH, then the arrow should be pointing towards the inside. This reduces the information processing time for the users so they can just follow the direction and easily open the door.
In addition, it should be effortless to use the handler. If the door is extremely heavy, how to leverage the power is important. We can use a long handler to minimize the strength required.

### What is Angular, and how does it differ from React? You may need to conduct independent research and learning for this (10 marks)
Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Users can build applications in HTML, CSS and Typescript. Angular uses regular DOM and updates the entire tree structure of HTML tags. React can be packaged with other programming libraries and Angular is a complete solution in itself. React uses one-way data binding but Angular uses the two-way data binding method.

### Please describe Redux in as much detail - especially consider: why would someone use it? What is it? What's the benefit of using it? Are there any potential drawbacks to using it? How can it be added to a project? What is dispatch, provider, actions, etc? (15 marks)
Redux is a state store that keeps the states of your application and each component can access any state from this store. In an app where data is shared among components, it is difficult to manage different states. Redux allows you to manage your app’s state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable, especially for large-scale apps. Redux is more maintainable and easy for debugging.
There is a central store that holds the entire state of the application. Each component can access the stored state without having to use props from one component to another. There are three parts: actions, store, and reducers.
ACTION: Actions are events and can send data from the application to the Redux store via store.dispatch(). Action needs to contain a type of action and payload that contains the information that should be worked on by the action.
 
Reducer: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state of an application, perform an action and return a new state. How the state of an application changes is dependent on the action sent to the store. 

Store: It holds the application state. It is highly recommended to keep only one store in any Redux application. You can access the state stored, update the state and register or unregister listeners.

### Please describe Linux in as much detail as possible (feel free to use notes made during lessons, or draw from the lesson directly!). Especially consider: what is its history? Why would someone use it over other existing operating systems? How does Windows and Mac OSX differ to Linux? How does Linux function, what are some unique features to it? How can it be installed today? (10 marks)
Linux is an open-source free operating system just like Windows and Mac OS. Linux was developed in 1991. It is famous for security options that save users from viruses, malware, slowdowns, crashes, costly repairs and etc. Since it is open-source so the code can be adjusted according to users’ needs. In addition, Linux can be used for desktop applications, embedded systems, and server applications. There are many Linux distributions available in the market that provides a different flavor of the linux operating system to the users. Once Linux distro is chosen, the installation package can be downloaded and installed. You can switch between your existing OS and Linux OS.

### What are they, and which is better between Class components and Functional components? Provide a discussion. Consider: Go deep - how does each one work? What is the unique properties or behaviours to each one? Why would someone use one over the other? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each one? Who benefits from these advantages and disadvantages, who is it suitable for? (10 marks)
A functional component is a plain Javascript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component needs to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
Before hooks, functional components are stateless as they only accept data from props and render them to DOM. If a state is needed in your component, you can create a class component or you lift the state up to the parent component and pass it down to the functional component via props. Lifecycle hooks cannot be used in functional components as well but are from React.Component which is extended from class components. Hooks allow you to add states in functional components and lifecycle methods (useEffect).
Apparently, functional components are easier to read and test. You can write less code and there may be a performance boost for functional components in future React versions. It is difficult to write reusable logic in class components.
