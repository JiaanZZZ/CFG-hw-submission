We can use mysql.connector and create a dictionary to store database details such as host, user, password, database.
Then we can use mysql.connector.connect with database details to connect.
Afterwards, we use connection.cursor().execute(query,variable). For the query part, just input the normal SQL language.
If we want to fetch data, we can use for loop to get results from cursor.
If we want to insert data, we use cursor.execute(query,variable)
