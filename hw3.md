###What is OOP? How may you have already made use of it (e.g. class components)?
OOP relies on classes that are used as blueprints to create instances of objects. Each class can have attributes and methods which are protected for security reasons. Reusable OOP objects can be made for complex projects so that they will be easy to debug. For example, relations among objects can be addressed via inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
In React, we can write class components for each section of the website. For example, the navigation bar, display of the main body, and search function. They can be separated and brought together.

###What is Polymorphism?
It means designing objects to share behaviors. It allows the same method to execute different behaviors by overriding and overloading. For example, a child class can inherit from a parent class. The child class can use the methods from parent class but also override/overload those methods in order to show specific functionality.

###What is Abstraction?
It uses simple classes to represent the complexity i.e. it hides unnecessary details from the user so that the user can use the logic without understanding the complex details behind it. For example, when you use a coffee machine, you only need to supply water and coffee beans and press the button in order to have a coffee without understanding how the coffee machine works.

###What is Inheritance?
It allows classes to inherit features of other classes. The child class can have access to methods and attributes from the parent class. At the same time, the child class can add their own methods and attributes. Common functionalities can be specified on parent level so that child class can directly inherit from parent class instead of creating their own ones.

###What is encapsulation?
The class contains attributes and methods but only selected attributes and methods are exposed to the outer class. Encapsulation hides the internal code implementation inside a class. Fields need to be declared as private or public so that limited access to the class can be granted.

###Agile development?
Agile is an iterative approach to managing projects and developing software in order to deliver value to customers faster. This approach is flexible and responds to short-term, smaller design challenges as they emerged so that new features and improvements can be incorporated.

###Waterfall development?
It is a sequential and linear development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development, and testing), which each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins.

###How do they differ? Which is suited for which situation?
The agile methodology will move through a series of cycles throughout the project. The development phase includes review, feedback, and approval. Any ad-hoc changes and challenges can be added to the process or reflected onto next sprint.
The waterfall methodology is a linear process of moving tasks through the phases of defining requirements, designing the implementation, implementing the work item and verifying implementation, etc.
Agile was developed as a flexible method that incorporates changes of direction even late in the process, as well as taking feedback throughout the process. The waterfall methodology is ideal for projects where the end result is clearly established from the beginning of the project. The expectations for the project and the deliverables of each stage are clear and are required in order to progress to the next phase.
