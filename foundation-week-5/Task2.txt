SQL Tables as database required to store:
    1. films for each date
    2. for each film, there should be a list of displaying time, venue, available tickets
    3. For each film, a fact table to show what the detailed info of this film.

A website or phone app is required to show the booking system.
People can search for available film for a day, and check info about the film 
When tickets are sold out, no more booking can be made.
We also need to use payment API to take payments

Concerns: 
    1. Multiple people can book the same ticket at the same time.
    2. Too many people use the app at the same time may cause crush
    3. Remaining tickets should always be updated in case people paid but did not get the ticket.
