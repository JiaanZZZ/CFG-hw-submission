This is a mobile app which is purely for users who want to listen to music. Since it is a mobile app which the size of the screen is small, 
the whole screen space is fully utilised to display. In addition, too many complicated background patterns will make the whole app quite confusing.
Therefore plain color is chosen as background. The button colors are contrast color to the background so that users can see all the buttons clear even if the screen is small. 
The information of songs/albums is displayed clearly when they play music and they can skip and pause.

Users can have their own accounts to store listening history and save songs.
There are three pages which are Sign in page, search page and listening page.
For the search page, the search results are return below the search bar so that the user can easily adjust the input to search bar if the results are not desirable.
